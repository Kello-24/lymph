# A probabilistic model of lymphatic tumor progression

This package contains code to model the spread of microscopic metastases through a system of lymph node levels (LNLs), using either a Bayesian network or a hidden Markov model. It is a pure-Python implementation under MIT license.

We also wrote a paper on the topic that will cover the mathematics and not too many details about the implementation.

The documentation can be found [here](https://lymph-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Writing tests is in progress.
