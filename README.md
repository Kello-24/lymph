This package contains code to model the spread of microscopic metastases through a system of lymph node levels (LNLs), using either a Bayesian network or a hidden Markov model. It is a pure-Python implementation under MIT license.

We also wrote a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94427-7) on the topic that covers the mathematics and not too many details about the implementation.
