lymph.py
========

This small pure-python package is an implementation of our model on metastatic 
spread of head & neck cancer (head & neck squamous cell carcinoma, to be 
precise). It is published under the MIT license on 
`github <https://github.com/rmnldwg/lymph>`_ and can hence be used freely. 
Here, in this documentation, we give you an insight in how to use this 
implementation but not how it works under the hood. This has been layed out in 
much detail in our `paper <www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91544-1>`_.
