Installation
============

This package is not (yet) on PyPI, so it must be installed from a local 
directory. To do this, first clone the github repository

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/rmnldwg/lymph.git
    cd lymph

From here you can either use `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .

or the file ``setup.py``

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py

.. note:: You will need to have  python 3.6 or higher installed.

In the future we plan to make the ``lymph`` package available on PyPI, so that 
it may be easier to install using `pip` or `conda <https://conda.io>`_.
